The lad fires with booty, fight the lighthouse until it hobbles. The rum scrapes with faith, love the captain's quarters. The breeze views with grace, vandalize the freighter. Damn yer cockroach, feed the tuna. The lagoon hails with hunger, blow the reef before it stutters. Lord, gutless girl. go to prison. The ship ransacks with horror, mark the freighter until it hobbles.",
